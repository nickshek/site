# Development Rules

## Branch Strategy

**⚠️ IMPORTANT: Master branch auto-deploys to production!**

### Default Workflow for Code Changes

1. **Create a feature branch** from `master`
   ```bash
   git checkout master
   git pull origin master
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

2. **Make changes and commit**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "feat: your changes"
   ```

3. **Push and create Pull Request**
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```

4. **Wait for review and approval** before merging to master

### Why?

- `master` branch triggers GitHub Actions deployment
- Changes are automatically deployed to production (nickshek.github.io)
- Pull Requests allow review before production deployment
- Prevents accidental breaking changes in production

### Exception

Only emergency hotfixes or critical bug fixes may be committed directly to master after explicit approval.

**Agent Note:** Always create PR for any code changes in this repository. Never commit directly to master without explicit permission.
